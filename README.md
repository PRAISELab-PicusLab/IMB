# ‚öïÔ∏è IMD (Italian Medical Dataset) üáÆüáπ

**IMD (Italian Medical Dataset)** is a cutting-edge resource for **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** in the medical domain, specifically designed to improve the accuracy and reliability of **Question Answering (QA)** models in the **Italian language**. The dataset is split into two primary components:

- **IMD-QA**: Questions and answers extracted from Italian medical forums, reflecting informal language used by patients and healthcare professionals.
- **IMD-MCQA**: Multiple-choice questions from Italian medical specialization exams, ideal for training models focused on structured and formal medical queries.

## üßπ Preprocessing

### IMD-QA üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è

- **Data Cleaning**: Removal of incomplete or truncated questions, metadata (doctor signatures, timestamps), and textual inconsistencies while preserving the original medical intent.
- **Text Normalization & Answer Reformulation**: Answers were reformulated using **Llama3-Med42-8B**, a Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuned for medical applications. The focus was on:
  - Eliminating redundancy and colloquial language.
  - Ensuring stylistic consistency across responses.
  - Enhancing readability and grammatical accuracy.
- **Anonymization**: The model identified and removed personally identifiable information (PII) such as patient names, doctor names, healthcare facilities, etc.

### IMD-MCQA üìù

- **Data Organization**: The dataset's multiple-choice questions were already structured, so the preprocessing mainly focused on standardizing the data format and ensuring consistency across entries.

## üè∑Ô∏è Data Categorization

The **IMD-QA** dataset was organized into major categories using **unsupervised topic modeling**. Techniques like **BERTopic**, **UMAP**, and **HDBSCAN** were used to group semantically similar questions into macro-categories. This approach enables flexible and interpretable categorization without rigid constraints.
